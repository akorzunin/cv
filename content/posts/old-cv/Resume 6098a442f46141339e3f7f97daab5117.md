# Resume

# ALEXEY KORZUNIN

> I'm a Python developer based in Kirov. I have 1 year of freelance experience making back-ends, APIs, CRUDs and models for databases, telegram/discord bots

I have scientific research background in the field of physics. That makes me feel fluent w/ lots of complicated terms and understand problems that can be solved mathematically.

My focus area for the past few years has been back-end development, but I'm also skilled in embedded developing, circuit engineering/design/layout.
